Justification goes here

How to carry local patches against C-TAP? Just vendor the code in (current approach)?
Or use submodule? But then we have to choose where to host the submod with our patches on top.

How to use prove (or other runner)?

Eventually, run along with regular `make test` target?

Do we want to be able to test without a full `make all` ? Requires more detailed dependency tracking in the makefile

Roadmap / milestones go here:
* Proof-of-concept runnable as `make unittests`
* Integration with CI
* Useful tests of gitlib stuff

* Integration with stdlib work

* ???
